# ClientIntake
for use in the law office that I currently work in to better handle new clients and add efficiency to the workflow

My intention is to essentially combine the client intake questions word doc and common resons word doc, it will have information tab so taht if someone is old fashioned and wants to write all this down they fully can, if they simply w dont want to use this, thats ok too, but i think this would be a reat opportunity to learn not only how to create  UI on python, but to better understand how it interacts with different components like a table or data in general
